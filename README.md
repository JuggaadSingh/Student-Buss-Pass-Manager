# Student-Buss-Pass-Manager
This is a Student Bus Pass Management System developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows students to add, view, and manage their bus passes for both monthly and yearly durations. All data is stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage, so the passes remain visible even after refreshing the page.
